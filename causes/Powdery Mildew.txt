Causes of Powdery Mildew in Plants

Powdery mildew is caused by various fungal species, including *Erysiphe*, *Podosphaera*, and *Golovinomyces*, which affect a wide range of plants such as cucumbers, grapes, roses, and tomatoes. Unlike many other fungal diseases, powdery mildew thrives in warm, dry conditions with high humidity rather than excessive moisture. The fungus spreads through airborne spores, which land on plant surfaces and form white, powdery fungal growth on leaves, stems, and flowers. As the infection progresses, the affected leaves may curl, turn yellow, and drop prematurely, weakening the plant and reducing yield. The disease spreads rapidly in crowded plantings with poor air circulation.  

Pesticides for Powdery Mildew in Plants
To effectively control powdery mildew, the following fungicides and organic treatments can be used:

Sulfur-Based Fungicides – Elemental sulfur and sulfur dust disrupt fungal cell growth and are effective preventive treatments.

Neem Oil – Acts as a natural antifungal agent, preventing spore germination and slowing down disease spread.

Potassium Bicarbonate – A contact fungicide that alters pH levels on leaf surfaces, making them inhospitable for fungal growth.

Copper-Based Fungicides – Copper hydroxide and copper sulfate provide some control but should be used cautiously to avoid plant toxicity.

Mancozeb – A broad-spectrum protectant fungicide that helps prevent powdery mildew from developing.

Triazole Fungicides – Products containing tebuconazole or propiconazole offer systemic control by inhibiting fungal enzyme production.

Azoxystrobin & Pyraclostrobin – Strobilurin fungicides that effectively prevent and control powdery mildew by blocking fungal respiration.

Bacillus-Based Biopesticides – Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens serve as natural biocontrol agents that suppress fungal infections.

Milk Spray (Natural Remedy) – A diluted milk solution (1:10 ratio with water) can act as a mild fungicide by altering leaf surface conditions.

Hydrogen Peroxide & Baking Soda Solutions – Both can help kill fungal spores and prevent new infections when applied as foliar sprays.
