#  Plant Disease Detection with GUI + Telegram Alerts

An AI-powered desktop application that detects plant leaf diseases from either uploaded images or real-time webcam feed using a custom-trained **VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model.  
It provides a detailed diagnosis, including the **disease name, confidence level**, and a **suggested cure/solution**, all displayed in an intuitive **Tkinter-based GUI**.  
The application also sends **instant Telegram alerts** containing the predicted disease along with the image.

##  How It Works

This model supports **two modes of disease detection**:

- Real-time Detection: Using a webcam or external camera (e.g., phone camera via Wi-Fi)
- Image Upload Detection: Upload any leaf image for prediction

> In image upload mode, the system provides the **disease prediction**, **confidence score**, and also reads a **text file containing the cause and solution** from the `solutions/` folder.  
> For real-time detection, it can use either your laptop webcam or a **phone camera over Wi-Fi** (IP Webcam supported) for remote analysis.
